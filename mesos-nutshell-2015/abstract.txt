Operating apps at scale is the new normal. With Mesosphere DCOS—the distributed analog to a traditional single-host operating system—building and managing highly-available fault-tolerant apps becomes easy. DCOS combines notable open source projects with Mesosphere components to provide the key building blocks of an operating system (kernel, init, scheduler, CLI, API). During the talk, we will focus on the architecture of Apache Mesos, the heart of DCOS, a cluster manager that provides efficient resource isolation and sharing across distributed applications, or frameworks. We also touch the framework API, and discuss some real-world usage examples.

Alex Rukletsov is on the Mesosphere core team in Hamburg and focuses on open source Apache Mesos. During past years Alex was segmenting medical images and investigating behaviour of human vessels in several German research institutes. His areas of interests include distributed systems, object recognition, probabilistic and heuristic algorithms.
